\# Wanderlust



Wanderlust is a listings web application that I am building to practice and improve my full-stack development skills.



The project is built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and EJS. It allows users to create, view, edit, and delete listings. I have focused on writing clean backend logic, proper validation, and maintaining a structured codebase.



This project is still under development. I am actively working on improving it and plan to deploy it and add a React frontend in the future.
