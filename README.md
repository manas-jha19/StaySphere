# StaySphere

StaySphere is a full-stack property listing web application inspired by platforms like Airbnb.

I built this project to practice and apply real-world backend concepts like authentication, authorization, database relationships, image uploads, and location-based features — not just CRUD operations.

The goal was to create something close to a production-ready app while keeping the UI simple and functional.
